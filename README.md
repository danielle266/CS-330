The design skills and development strategies that I developed in this course have given me an inside on how to design things such as a game.  Creating 3D scenes was interesting and I enjoyed it. The last module will help me understand how to develop a shooter game. I will use that as a reference when developing. The design process I used was to plan out what I wanted to work on and how long.  This helped me focus on one objective at a time. If I got stuck, then I would take a break and come back to it. What really helped me stay on top of my work was starting early in the week. I was able to work through any problem early in the week. I will be using this method for now on. My coding has gotten better. I am able to understand why something is not working and what code is needed to make it work. What led me to project completion is understanding that if something is not working then it is either not defined or need the right code.


Computational graphics give me new knowledge and skills that I am able to create scenes such as project one and two. I am not sure where my career will take me, but I want to have a career where I develop and create new things. Everyday should be something new to create.
